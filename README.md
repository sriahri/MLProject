**Decription**
Argumentative Writing is a critical skill for a student to foster throughout their academic career. It is a 
method for students to organize and present analytical conclusions to persuade the audience. This type of skill 
teaches students to evaluate conflicting claims and assess testimonies. At the same time, it develops students to 
critically think and logically express their opinions in a scholarly fashion. Such skills should be reinforced with 
feedback so that students can consistently improve their argumentative writing skills. However, there is a lack of 
manpower for teachers to constantly read an essay and give feedback. Additionally, the resources available 
pertaining to Black and Hispanic students disproportionately impact their writing skills to be below the normal 
range compared to their peers. Although there are many automated writing feedback tools available, many of 
them have limitations within argumentative writing. These tools fail to assess the caliber of a student's 
argumentative format such as the elements of an argumentative writing. The tools that are available also are 
inaccessible to underserved schools due to the cost. The objective of this project will be to evaluate and assess 
studentâ€™s writing into three categories: effective, adequate, or ineffective. Our model will be trained on data that 
represents argumentative writings from 6th to 12th grade in the United States. With automated feedback, students 
will be able to get instant reports of their writing which will allow students to get more practice and elevate their 
writing.

**Goals**
The goal of this project is to classify argumentative elements in student writing as "effective," "adequate," 
or "ineffective." We would want to create a model trained on data that is representative of the 6th-12th grade 
population in the United States in order to minimize bias. The model built hopefully helps pave the way for 
students to receive enhanced feedback on their argumentative writing. With automated guidance, students can 
complete more assignments and ultimately become more confident, proficient writers. 
We plan on using the Python programming language with a version greater than 3.8. We are thinking of 
using the Machine Learning algorithms like RandomForest, NaiveBayes, etc depending on the data statistics and 
the model performance with respect to the data. We are considering it as a classification problem right now. Since 
this is related to the text processing tasks, we might also try to use some RNNs if needed. First, all the essays are 
cleaned, then try converting the words in the essay into tokens, or maybe try creating a sequential network with 
the words. The approach to the problem might vary depending on the trails that are done on the data.
